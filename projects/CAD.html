          <p>In this page I will show you what I learned during this module. </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>What is CAD?</h2>
          <p>CAD is short for "computer aided design", and is used to create designs digitally, whether it is 2D or 3D. This page will cover the basics of 3D CAD. </p>
          <hr>
          <p>Our goal is to create this 3D model of a chess knight, so that we can then 3D print it later on. I will be using Autodesk Fusion 360, although any 3D CAD software can achieve the same result.</p>
          <img src="../images/chess knight.png" alt="chess knight picture">
          <br>
          <p>To create this model, we're going to use 2 functions, extrusion, and revolution. But lets start with the basics.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Creating a sketch</h2>
          <p>All 3D models start from a 2D sketch, which we can perform 3D operations on to get our 3D model. So lets start with a simple 2D sketch to learn how to create sketches in Fusion 360.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Here's a simple video showing you how I created a sketch in Fusion 360.</p>

          <h2>Chess Knight</h2>
          <p>Now that you know how to create a sketch, lets learn how to model a Chess Knight using 3D operations like extrusions and revolutions, and some additional 2D sketching tools like arcs and splines. Check out the video below and follow along!</p>

          <p>That's how I modelled my Chess Knight in Fusion 360. I made some modifications such as hollowing the base to speed up the 3D printing process, and chamfering some edges to make it look more aesthetic, and I show you how use the chamfer and shell funtion in the video below. I also teach an alternative way of hollowing your base if the shell function has issues like mine did. </p>

          <p>Congrats! You now know how to model a Chess piece in Fusion 360 and we're ready to prepare it for 3D printing. Click <a href="CAD.html">here</a> to learn about the 3D printing process. </p>
