          <h1><b>CAD</b></h1>
          <p>In this page I will show you what I learned during this module. </p>
          <hr>
          <h2>What is CAD?</h2>
          <p>CAD is short for "computer aided design", and is used to create designs digitally, whether it is 2D or 3D. This page will cover the basics of 3D CAD. </p>
          <hr>
          <p>Our goal is to create this 3D model of a chess knight, so that we can then 3D print it later on. I will be using Autodesk Fusion 360, although any 3D CAD software can achieve the same result.</p>
          <img src="../images/chess knight.png" alt="chess knight picture">
          <br>
          <p>To create this model, we're going to use 2 functions, extrusion, and revolution. But lets start with the basics.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Creating a sketch</h2>
          <p>All 3D models start from a 2D sketch, which we can perform 3D operations on to get our 3D model. So lets start with a simple 2D sketch to learn how to create sketches in Fusion 360.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Here's a simple video showing you how I created a sketch in Fusion 360.</p>
          <video src="../videos/2d sketch tutorial.mp4"  poster="../images/Drawing 1.png" controls>

          </video>
          <hr>
          <h2>Chess Knight</h2>
          <p>Now that you know how to create a sketch, lets learn how to model a Chess Knight using 3D operations like extrusions and revolutions, and some additional 2D sketching tools like arcs and splines. Check out the video below and follow along!</p>
          <video src="../videos/Chess knight compressed.mp4"  poster="../images/chess knight.png" controls>

          </video>
          <p>That's how I modelled my Chess Knight in Fusion 360. I made some modifications such as hollowing the base to speed up the 3D printing process, and chamfering some edges to make it look more aesthetic, and I show you how use the chamfer and shell funtion in the video below. I also teach an alternative way of hollowing your base if the shell function has issues like mine did. </p>

          <p>Congrats! You now know how to model a Chess piece in Fusion 360 and we're ready to prepare it for 3D printing. Click <a href="3D CAD.html">here</a> to learn about the 3D printing process. </p>

          <h2>Parametric Modelling</h2>
          <p>In my previous guides, I used the conventional method of dimensioning and modelling. In this section, I'm going to show you an alternative method of modelling called Parametric Modelling.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>What is Parametric Modelling?</h2>
          <p>Paramatric Modelling is a design technique that allows the designer to change the shape and dimensions of their model without editing the dimensions directly. This is very useful when you know the shape of the model you want to create, and makes editing the dimensions fast and easy. Watch the video below to find out to use Paramatric Modelling.</p>
          <video src="../videos/parametric modelling.mp4" controls poster="posterimage.jpg">
            </video>
          <p>To summarise the video, there are 3 steps to parametric modelling.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create your model parameters by going to modify > change parameters, and creating them there</li>
            <li>Use your parameters to dimension your part</li>
            <li>Go back to change parameters to edit the dimensions</li>
          </ol>
          <hr>
          <h2>Music Box</h2>
          <p>Now that you know the basics of parametric modelling, let's put it to use by modelling a music box that we can laser cut later on.</p>
          <img width=50% src="../images/music box model.png" alt="picture of my fusion 360 model">
          <p>This is perfect for parametric modelling because we know the general shape of the model, so we can define certain parameters like length, width and height. We also know the thickness of the plywood we will be cutting it from so we can define that too.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Video Tutorial</h2>
          <p>This model is more complex and has more steps than the Chess Knight, so to save you the trouble of reading through all the steps, here is a concise video of how to create your own music box model. Feel free to follow along at your own pace.</p>
          <video src="../videos/music box tutorial compressed.mp4" controls poster="../images/music box thumbnail.png">

          </video>
          <p>In the video I mention extruding a hole at the side for a winding mechanism, and the dimensions for that will vary based on the music box mechanism you purchase. I put an image of my dimensions below, but if you choose not to follow it, what you're left with is a pretty cool box anyway.</p>
          <img width=70% src="../images/music box model 2.png" alt="sketch pic">
          <p>If you've followed these steps, you should be somewhat familliar with parametric modelling and how to use it. Now it's time to laser cut this music box out of plywood. Click <a href="#">here</a> to find out how.</p>
