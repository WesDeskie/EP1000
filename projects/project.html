          <h1><b>Final Project</b></h1>
          <p>After learning about all these prototyping skills, it's time to put them all together into one final project. In this webpage, I will go into all the details of my Final Project.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Rubik's Cube Scrambler</h2>
          <h4>What is this?</h4>
          <p>For my Final Project, I will be designing and fabricating a machine that scrambles the most popular puzzle in the world. The Rubik's Cube.</p>
          <h4>What does it do?</h4>
          <p>The Rubik's Cube was invented by Erno Rubik in 1974 and quickly soared in popularity. It was not long before competitions were held where players known as Speedcubers would compete to solve the cube as quickly as possible. The aim of my machine is to scramble a Rubik's cube quickly so that Speedcubers can practice effeciently.</p>
          <h4>What are it's features?</h4>
          <p>My Rubik's Cube Scrambler will use five stepper motors to rotate five different faces of the cube. With this configuration, the machine can scramble the cube into any of it's 43 quintillion scrambled states, all of which will be randomly generated using an Arduino Mega.  </p>
          <h4>What will I make and how?</h4>
