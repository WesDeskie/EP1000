          <h1><b>Final Project</b></h1>
          <p>After learning about all these prototyping skills, it's time to put them all together into one final project. In this webpage, I will go into all the details of my Final Project.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Rubik's Cube Scrambler</h2>
          <h4>What is this?</h4>
          <p>For my Final Project, I will be designing and fabricating a machine that scrambles the most popular puzzle in the world. The Rubik's Cube.</p>
          <h4>What does it do?</h4>
          <p>The Rubik's Cube was invented by Erno Rubik in 1974 and quickly soared in popularity. It was not long before competitions were held where players known as Speedcubers would compete to solve the cube as quickly as possible. The aim of my machine is to scramble a Rubik's cube quickly so that Speedcubers can practice effeciently.</p>
          <h4>What are it's features?</h4>
          <p>My Rubik's Cube Scrambler will use five stepper motors to rotate five different faces of the cube. With this configuration, the machine can scramble the cube into any of it's 43 quintillion scrambled states, all of which will be randomly generated using an Arduino Mega.  </p>
          <h4>What will I make and how?</h4>

<h2>Conceptualisation</h2>
<p>Why did I choose to make a Rubik's Cube scrambler? For many people, myself included, solving puzzles is more than just a hobby, but a passion. These Speedcubers spend many hours scrambling and solving the cube, trying to get their solve times down.</p>
<p>Why a scrambler instead of a solver? Simple. As a speedsolver, solving the cube is pretty much childsplay. Therefore solving the cube is not an issue. The far more tedious task for practicing is the process of scrambling the cube to the scramble randomly generated by a computer. Therefore, having a machine to scramble the cube would save lots of time and effort. </p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Every project starts with an idea. The next step is to create sketches and models to help visualise your idea. In order to get inspiration for my design, I did some research on some of the existing designs for similar projects.</p>
<p>Many of these designs used 6 different motors with a shaft attached to the centre pieces of each face to turn the cube. Click <a href="https://stevcooo.medium.com/from-zero-to-rubiks-cube-solving-robot-ad3a2838cd" target="_blank">here</a> to see such a project. </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hinvKkamiUI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This design is pretty solid, it turns the cube pretty quickly. The only disadvantage being that the cube cannot be taken out easily.</p>
<p>The other common design involves using 2 servos to grip 2 sides of the cube, and 2 servos to rotate the face, or rotate the whole cube. <a href="https://stevcooo.medium.com/from-zero-to-rubiks-cube-solving-robot-ad3a2838cd" target="_blank">Instructables tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>While being easy to take out and using less components, the gripping mechanism is more complex and the turning is slower.</p>
<p>Then, I stumbled upon a robot called the "GAN Robot". This robot is manufactured by GAN, a Chinese speedcube manufacturer. This Robot is designed to work in tandem with their own "Smart Cube" and mobile app to scramble and solve the cube. Their design uses only 5 motors to turn 5 faces of the cube, as it is possible to scramble the cube into any state by turning only 5 faces.</p>

<p>This was the most ideal design as the turning speed was very fast and the cube could easily be taken out. Therefore I used this design as inspiration for my project.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CAD</h2>
<p>I used Fusion360 to model my design, borrowing some elements from the GAN robot and modifying certain attributes to fit my components. The photo below shows my initial design.</p>
<img width = "80% "src="../images/First cad .png" alt="">
<p>This was just to get an idea of how the machine would look. It is far from perfect, so I would look for areas that need improvement and redesign those.</p>
<hr>
<p>After a few iterations, I finished my 3D model. It looks more refined,the main improvement being to the rotary slider, as well as the motor housings. Here's a link to my <a href="https://a360.co/3oBF5pi" target="_blank">3D model</a>.</p>
<img width="80%" src="../images/Final project 3d model.png" alt="">
<p>The motor configuration is similar to the GAN robot, but the mechanism to engage the motors is different. My design uses rotary to linear motion to rotate the motors around a pivot and engage the centre pieces of the cube.</p>
<p>Because the motors need to engage the centre pieces, I had to design dedicated centre caps and some sort of gripper to grip the centre caps. The cube I am using is the "YiXun Little Magic", so you may need to modify the design if you plan on using a different cube. The motor on the bottom will need a slightly different height of gripper to ensure that the cube is in the centre of all the motors. I've included the 3D model for the gripper and cap  <a href="https://a360.co/3LV2WKt" target="_blank">here</a>, and the bottom one is <a href="https://a360.co/35lSMBO" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<img width="80%" src="../images/cap cad 1.png" alt="">
<p>I replicated the original cap design and cut a groove into it for the prong to interface with.</p>
<hr>
<img width="80%" src="../images/prong cad.png" alt="">
<p>I created a prong that matches with the groove in the cap. I also extruded a profile that the shaft of the motor can fit into, and I also added a hole in the side for a 2mm screw to hold the prong in place.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Fabrication</h2>
<p>After making our 3D model, we can start fabricating our design. When I designed this project, I intended to laser cut the majority of the parts as it is faster than 3D printing. Therefore, almost all of the parts will be laser cut, except for the parts that are not flat or have complex geometry such as the centre caps.</p>
<h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, most of the parts are flat panels designed to be cut out of 3mm acrylic sheets with the laser cutter. I cut all the parts out using the Fablab's Universal laser cutter with the settings as follows.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Power: 40%</li>
  <li>Speed: 20%</li>
  <li>PPI: 60</li>
</ol>

<h2>3D Printing</h2>
<p>As for 3D printing, I reserved this method of fabrication for the more organic parts in my design. These include the modified center caps of my cube, the prongs to grip the cube, and parts of my sliding mechanism.</p>
<video src="../videos/3d print timelapse.mp4" autoplay loop poster="posterimage.jpg">

<h3>Sliding Mechanism</h3>
<p>I used a layer height of 0.12 with supports touching the base at 50mm/s</p>
<hr>
<video src="../videos/cap timelapse.mp4" autoplay loop poster="posterimage.jpg">

<h3>Center Cap</h3>
<p>I used a layer height of 0.2 with no supports at 50mm/s</p>

<ul>
  <li>Five stepper motors (NEMA 17)</li>
  <li>One Arduino Mega 2560 OR MEGA Pro</li>
  <li>Five H-Bridge drivers (I used L298 mini)</li>
  <li>One push button (Not in picture)</li>

  <li>Breadboard</li>
  <li>Four dia 5mm brass rods about 60mm long</li>
  <li>M3 threaded inserts</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>When putting together this project, there are a few tools that are neccesary for assembly, but also some tools that are just nice to have and make the final assembly look more finished.</p>
<h3>Neccesary Tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Soldering Iron: For soldering components and inserting threaded inserts</li>
  <li>Hand drill/Drill press: For drilling holes for power input, LED, ON/OFF switch.</li>
  <li>Sandpaper</li>
  <li>Some form of glue (I used mainly super glue)</li>
  <li>Hairdryer or heat gun: for shrinking heat shrink</li>
  <li>Wire cutter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p>Now we're ready to assemble. Let's ignore the electronics and coding for now and see how to assemble the body of the machine together.</p>
<p>I started with the motor housing, as they are the easiest and least risky to assemble. I used super glue to glue the sides, top and bottom together, leaving the front for last in case I needed to change out a motor.</p>
<img width="70%" src="../images/motor housing.jpg" alt="">
<p>Because I was doing most of the assembly at home, I happened to have a small vise that I used to help glue the small pieces together, so if you happen to have access to a vise, that might help with the accuracy of your assembly.</p>
<img width="70%" src="../images/motor vise.jpg" alt="">
<p>For the rest of the main housing, assembly is pretty simple, glue the side panels to the top, and glue the pivots into the top. The only thing I did differently was drill holes into the side panels for some ventillation, which I will go into more detail in the electronics section.</p>
