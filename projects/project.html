          <h1><b>Final Project</b></h1>
          <p>After learning about all these prototyping skills, it's time to put them all together into one final project. In this webpage, I will go into all the details of my Final Project.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Rubik's Cube Scrambler</h2>
          <h4>What is this?</h4>
          <p>For my Final Project, I will be designing and fabricating a machine that scrambles the most popular puzzle in the world. The Rubik's Cube.</p>
          <h4>What does it do?</h4>
          <p>The Rubik's Cube was invented by Erno Rubik in 1974 and quickly soared in popularity. It was not long before competitions were held where players known as Speedcubers would compete to solve the cube as quickly as possible. The aim of my machine is to scramble a Rubik's cube quickly so that Speedcubers can practice effeciently.</p>
          <h4>What are it's features?</h4>
          <p>My Rubik's Cube Scrambler will use five stepper motors to rotate five different faces of the cube. With this configuration, the machine can scramble the cube into any of it's 43 quintillion scrambled states, all of which will be randomly generated using an Arduino Mega.  </p>
          <h4>What will I make and how?</h4>

<h2>Conceptualisation</h2>
<p>Why did I choose to make a Rubik's Cube scrambler? For many people, myself included, solving puzzles is more than just a hobby, but a passion. These Speedcubers spend many hours scrambling and solving the cube, trying to get their solve times down.</p>
<p>Why a scrambler instead of a solver? Simple. As a speedsolver, solving the cube is pretty much childsplay. Therefore solving the cube is not an issue. The far more tedious task for practicing is the process of scrambling the cube to the scramble randomly generated by a computer. Therefore, having a machine to scramble the cube would save lots of time and effort. </p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Every project starts with an idea. The next step is to create sketches and models to help visualise your idea. In order to get inspiration for my design, I did some research on some of the existing designs for similar projects.</p>
<p>Many of these designs used 6 different motors with a shaft attached to the centre pieces of each face to turn the cube. Click <a href="https://stevcooo.medium.com/from-zero-to-rubiks-cube-solving-robot-ad3a2838cd" target="_blank">here</a> to see such a project. </p>

<p>This design is pretty solid, it turns the cube pretty quickly. The only disadvantage being that the cube cannot be taken out easily.</p>
<p>The other common design involves using 2 servos to grip 2 sides of the cube, and 2 servos to rotate the face, or rotate the whole cube. <a href="https://stevcooo.medium.com/from-zero-to-rubiks-cube-solving-robot-ad3a2838cd" target="_blank">Instructables tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>While being easy to take out and using less components, the gripping mechanism is more complex and the turning is slower.</p>
<p>Then, I stumbled upon a robot called the "GAN Robot". This robot is manufactured by GAN, a Chinese speedcube manufacturer. This Robot is designed to work in tandem with their own "Smart Cube" and mobile app to scramble and solve the cube. Their design uses only 5 motors to turn 5 faces of the cube, as it is possible to scramble the cube into any state by turning only 5 faces.</p>

<p>This was the most ideal design as the turning speed was very fast and the cube could easily be taken out. Therefore I used this design as inspiration for my project.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CAD</h2>
<p>I used Fusion360 to model my design, borrowing some elements from the GAN robot and modifying certain attributes to fit my components. Here's a link to my <a href="https://a360.co/3oBF5pi">3D model</a>.</p>
<img width="80%" src="../images/Final project 3d model.png" alt="">
<p>The motor configuration is similar to the GAN robot, but the mechanism to engage the motors is different. My design uses rotary to linear motion to rotate the motors around a pivot and engage the centre pieces of the cube.</p>
<p>Because the motors need to engage the centre pieces, I had to design dedicated centre caps and some sort of gripper to grip the centre caps. I've included the 3D model <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Fabrication</h2>
<p>After making our 3D model, we can start fabricating our design. When I designed this project, I intended to laser cut the majority of the parts as it is faster than 3D printing. Therefore, almost all of the parts will be laser cut, except for the parts that are not flat or have complex geometry such as the centre caps.</p>
