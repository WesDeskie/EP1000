          <h2>GitHub</h2>
          <p>In this webpage, I will show you how to implement version control using GitHub and GitHub Desktop.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
          <p>GitHub is a service that can be used for many things, but for me, it is most useful for version control. I can upload all the files in my webpage, and GitHub will help me keep them there, and I can edit my files on another computer, or if I was working on a group project, my teammates can edit the files on their computer too.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>How do I use GitHub?</h2>
          <p>First thing you want to do is go to GitHub's website (<a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>). Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already, and next, create a new repository.</p>
          <video src="../videos/GitHub part 1.mp4" controls muted poster="posterimage.jpg">

          </video>
          <p>Take note of a few things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Give you repository a name and a description</li>
            <li>Remember to add a README file (This will contain information about you repository)</li>
            <li>Select "MIT License"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Just like that, you've created a repository.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Next, you want to add files to your repository.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Click on "Add file > Upload files"</li>
            <li>Select which files you want to upload</li>
            <li>Click "Commit changes"</li>
          </ul>
          <video src="../videos/GitHub part 2.mp4" controls muted poster="posterimage.jpg">

          </video>
          <p>In the video above you'll notice that after uploading your files, you can double click them to open them up in GitHub. You can actually edit it straight from GitHub, but I will show you a better alternative later.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Now that you've uploaded your files, you can open you website from GitHub itself.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go to "Settings > pages"</li>
            <li>Select your source branch as "main"</li>
            <li>Click "save"</li>
          </ul>
          <video src="../videos/GitHub part 3.mp4" controls muted poster="posterimage.jpg">

          </video>
          <p>You should see a link appear. Click on the link to open up your website, or share it with others to let them open it. Keep in mind that changes will take a while to appear in the link.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>GitHub Desktop</h2>
          <p>We've created a repository, now what? We can either edit files on GitHub, which is a bit troublesome, so instead we are going to clone our repository onto our computer using GitHub Desktop.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Download GitHub Desktop <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">here</a></li>
            <li>Log into your GitHub account</li>
          </ul>
          <p>First, you want to copy the repository link from GitHub like so.</p>

          </video>
          <p>This will help if you are not the creator of the repository. Next,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go to "file > clone repository"</li>
            <li>If you're the creator of the repository, you can select it from "GitHub.com"</li>
          </ul>
