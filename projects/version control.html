          <h2>GitHub</h2>
          <p>In this webpage, I will show you how to implement version control using GitHub and GitHub Desktop.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
          <p>GitHub is a service that can be used for many things, but for me, it is most useful for version control. I can upload all the files in my webpage, and GitHub will help me keep them there, and I can edit my files on another computer, or if I was working on a group project, my teammates can edit the files on their computer too.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>How do I use GitHub?</h2>
          <p>First thing you want to do is go to GitHub's website (<a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>). Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already, and next, create a new repository.</p>
          <video src="../videos/GitHub part 1.mp4" controls muted poster="posterimage.jpg">

          </video>
          <p>Take note of a few things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Give you repository a name and a description</li>
            <li>Remember to add a README file (This will contain information about you repository)</li>
            <li>Select "MIT License"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Just like that, you've created a repository.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Next, you want to add files to your repository.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Click on "Add file > Upload files"</li>
            <li>Select which files you want to upload</li>
            <li>Click "Commit changes"</li>
          </ul>
          <video src="../videos/GitHub part 2.mp4" controls muted poster="posterimage.jpg">

          </video>
          <p>In the video above you'll notice that after uploading your files, you can double click them to open them up in GitHub. You can actually edit it straight from GitHub, but I will show you a better alternative later.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Now that you've uploaded your files, you can open you website from GitHub itself.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go to "Settings > pages"</li>
            <li>Select your source branch as "main"</li>
            <li>Click "save"</li>
          </ul>
          <video src="../videos/GitHub part 3.mp4" controls muted poster="posterimage.jpg">

          </video>
          <p>You should see a link appear. Click on the link to open up your website, or share it with others to let them open it. Keep in mind that changes will take a while to appear in the link.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>GitHub Desktop</h2>
          <p>We've created a repository, now what? We can either edit files on GitHub, which is a bit troublesome, so instead we are going to clone our repository onto our computer using GitHub Desktop.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Download GitHub Desktop <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">here</a></li>
            <li>Log into your GitHub account</li>
          </ul>
          <p>First, you want to copy the repository link from GitHub like so.</p>
          <video src="../videos/GitHub part 3.mp4" controls muted poster="posterimage.jpg">

          </video>
          <p>This will help if you are not the creator of the repository. Next,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go to "file > clone repository"</li>
            <li>If you're the creator of the repository, you can select it from "GitHub.com"</li>
          </ul>
          <img width=75% src="../images/github desktop 1.jpg" alt="github desktop">
          <img width=75% src="../images/github desktop 2.jpg" alt="github desktop">
          <p>If you are not the creator, you can click "URL" and paste the link you copied earlier.</p>
          <img width=75% src="../images/github desktop 3.jpg" alt="github desktop">
          <p>You've now succesfully cloned your repository. In your File Explorer, you should see a folder named "GitHub" under "Documents". Open it, and you will see all you cloned repositories. In your repository folder, you should see the files you uploaded, as well as the README file that you created.</p>
          <img width=75% src="../images/github desktop 4.jpg" alt="github desktop">
          <p>You can now open your files in a text editor, and edit them from there. Make some changes, and open up GitHub Desktop again. You will see what changes have been made. I made some changes to my index.html file in my demosite repository, lets see what GitHub Desktop shows.</p>
          <img width=75% src="../images/github desktop 5.jpg" alt="github desktop">
          <p>After making changes, write a summary of the changes you made, and click "commit changes"</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Push and Pull</h2>
          <p>After commiting your changes, you'll want to update the files on the GitHub website, and you do so by "Pushing" it to the origin like so:</p>
          <img width=75% src="../images/github desktop 6.jpg" alt="github desktop">
          <hr>
          <p>Now, let's say you've made a change on another computer, and you want to see those changes on your home computer. You could clone the repository again, but it's easier to use the "Pull" command. I've already made some changes to my repository, lets open up GitHub Desktop again. Click on "Fetch Origin", this will fetch the files from GitHub.</p>
          <img width=75% src="../images/github desktop 7.jpg" alt="github desktop">
          <p>Then, you can click on "Pull origin", to pull the changes onto your computer.</p>
          <img width=75% src="../images/github desktop 8.jpg" alt="github desktop">
          <p>If you open up your files in a text editor, you'll see the changes that you've made.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Version History</h2>
          <p>Lastly, if you want to see what changes have been made previously, you can click on the "History" tab. This will show you all the changes that have been made to your file.</p>
          <img width=75% src="../images/github desktop 9.jpg" alt="github desktop">
          <p>And that's how I used GitHub to manage my projects. Hopefully you understand how to use GitHub for version control and can implement it into you own projects!</p>
