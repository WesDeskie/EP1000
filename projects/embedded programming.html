        <h1>Embedded Programming</h1>
        <p>In this webpage I will be showing you the basics of embedded programming using an Arduino Board.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What is Embedded Programming?</h2>
        <p>Embedded Programming refers to the programming of embedded systems. Embedded systems are computer systems that have a dedicated function within a larger electronic or mechanical system to perform specific tasks.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Arduino Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>The embedded system device I will be teaching you about is the Arduino Board. The Arduino Board is huge in popularity for hobby makers and for rapid prototyping. </p>
        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p>There are a few types of Arduino Boards but the one I will talk about is the humble Arduino UNO. It's the most basic Arduino Board and its Atmel Atmega328P processor will be sufficient for 90 percent of your projects. Here are the specifications for the Arduino UNO and an image to help visualise the board layout.</p>
        <img width=50% src="../images/Arduino Uno.jpg" alt="Insert arduino pics h">
        <img width=50% src="../images/Arduino specs.png" alt="Insert arduino pics h">
        <p>Above you can see the specifications of the UNO Board. The important specs to take note of are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Operating Voltage.</li>
          <li>The number of Digital I/O Pins</li>
          <li>The number Analog Input Pins</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Operating Voltage</h3>
        <p>This refers to the voltage that the Arduino Board can output at it's output pins. This is important when choosing appropriate components for your project. For example, a large DC motor may not be able to operating on 5V, so you might have to consider using a smaller motor or using a separate power source.</p>
        <h3>Digital I/O Pins</h3>
        <p>Digital I/O pins are the pins that you can send or receive signals from. Knowing the number of I/O pins your board has is important as sometimes the number of output devices (i.e. LEDS, Buzzers, Sensors) may exceed the number of I/O pins on your Board, in which case, you may want to reconsider your project design by excluding certain components or using a multiplexer.</p>
        <h3>Analog Input Pins</h3>
        <p>Analog Input Pins are pins that can receive analog signals from components such as proximity or temperature sensors. They are the pins that you use whenever you need to receive any analog signal and convert them to digital signals. Knowing the number of Analog Input Pins on your board is important for the same reason I mentioned for Digital I/O pins.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Digital vs Analog</h2>
        <p>Before we start programming our Arduino Board, a quick lesson on Digital Electronics.</p>
        <p>Digital computing refers to logic that uses discrete values or digits, thus the name "Digital". Most commonly used are 1's and 0's.</p>
        <p>Analog computing uses continuous values that can have a range of values. For example, the temperature of a room is an analog value as the value can be 25 degrees, or 25.1 degrees, or 25.123 degrees. There are an infinite amount of values it can take on.</p>
        <p>Here's a comparison between a digital signal and an analog one.</p>
        <img width=50% src="../images/digital vs analog.png" alt="">
        <p>As you can see, the analog signal has values from -5V to 5V, and the digital signal only has values of 0V or 5V. Our Arduino Board mainly uses digital signals to do it's computing.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Arduino I/O</h2>
        <p>Now, we can start looking at the Arduino's I/O, or Input/Output. Let's start with digital outputs. As mentioned before, the Arduino deals with digital signals, and in this case, it's output pins can give two outputs. Either a "Logic 1 (HIGH)", or a "Logic 0 (LOW)". The HIGH and LOW refer to two discrete voltages. The LOW will be 0 Volts, and the HIGH will be 5 Volts.</p>
        <p>Now what does this all mean? Put simply, I can program the Arduino to give a Logic HIGH at one of its output pins, and if I measure the voltage at that pin, it'll be 5 Volts. That's great, now I can use this 5 Volts to power components like LEDs.</p>
        <p>Similarly, I can set the Arduino Board's pins as input pins, so that it can detect if there is 5 Volts going to that pin from an external source like a switch.</p>
        <p>The Arduino Board also has some analog input pins. These can be used to detect analog signals such as temperature.</p>
        <p>Some common input devices are:</p>
