        <h1>Embedded Programming</h1>
        <p>In this webpage I will be showing you the basics of embedded programming using an Arduino Board.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What is Embedded Programming?</h2>
        <p>Embedded Programming refers to the programming of embedded systems. Embedded systems are computer systems that have a dedicated function within a larger electronic or mechanical system to perform specific tasks.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Arduino Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>The embedded system device I will be teaching you about is the Arduino Board. The Arduino Board is huge in popularity for hobby makers and for rapid prototyping. </p>
        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p>There are a few types of Arduino Boards but the one I will talk about is the humble Arduino UNO. It's the most basic Arduino Board and its Atmel Atmega328P processor will be sufficient for 90 percent of your projects. Here are the specifications for the Arduino UNO and an image to help visualise the board layout.</p>

        <img width=50% src="../images/Arduino specs.png" alt="Insert arduino pics h">
        <p>Above you can see the specifications of the UNO Board. The important specs to take note of are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Operating Voltage.</li>
          <li>The number of Digital I/O Pins</li>
          <li>The number Analog Input Pins</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Operating Voltage</h3>
        <p>This refers to the voltage that the Arduino Board can output at it's output pins. This is important when choosing appropriate components for your project. For example, a large DC motor may not be able to operating on 5V, so you might have to consider using a smaller motor or using a separate power source.</p>
        <h3>Digital I/O Pins</h3>
        <p>Digital I/O pins are the pins that you can send or receive signals from. Knowing the number of I/O pins your board has is important as sometimes the number of output devices (i.e. LEDS, Buzzers, Sensors) may exceed the number of I/O pins on your Board, in which case, you may want to reconsider your project design by excluding certain components or using a multiplexer.</p>
        <h3>Analog Input Pins</h3>
        <p>Analog Input Pins are pins that can receive analog signals from components such as proximity or temperature sensors. They are the pins that you use whenever you need to receive any analog signal and convert them to digital signals. Knowing the number of Analog Input Pins on your board is important for the same reason I mentioned for Digital I/O pins.</p>
