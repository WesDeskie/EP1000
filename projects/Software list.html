        <h2>List of softwares</h2>
        <p>Here is the list of softwares I used throughout the module and why I chose to use them.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Text Editor (Atom)</h2>
        <p>I chose Atom as my text editor and while I could do with just using notepad, I found that Atom has many useful features that other text editors don't have such as predictive text, GitHub integration, and it's just easy to use in general</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Raster Editor (Adobe Photoshop)</h2>
        <p>I chose Adobe Photoshop because I happen to have some experience with using Photoshop, and more importantly, I also have the student license to use Photoshop.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Vector Editor (InkScape)</h2>
        <p>I chose InkScape because it is open source, and it is what our lecturer Mr Rodney recommended.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>CAD (Fusion 360)</h2>
        <p>I am very proficient at most CAD software and personally prefer Autodesk Inventor. However, on this occasion, I chose Autodesk Fusion 360 because it is more user friendly which would make my CAD tutorials easier for viewers to understand.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>IDE (Arduino)</h2>
        <p>Throughout this module we will be learning and using Arduino microcontrollers, and therefore it only makes sense to use their IDE.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Browser (Firefox)</h2>
        <p>I use Firefox all the time because of their privacy and security policies.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Screen capture (Windows snip and sketch)</h2>
        <p>I use snip and sketch because it is already integrated into Windows 10 and already has a convenient hotkey.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Screen recorder (Xbox Game Bar)</h2>
        <p>I use Xbox Game Bar for the same reason as snip and sketch. It is convenient and makes recording my tutorials easier.</p>
